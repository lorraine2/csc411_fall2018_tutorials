# CSC411 F18 Bayesian Optimization Tutorial

What follows is a description of the Bayesian Optimization tutorial for CSC411/2515 Fall 2018.

## Getting Started

The tutorial consists of a set of slides, followed ipython notebooks which implement a basic Bayesian optimization algorithm.
To get the code examples you may run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization.git
cd BayesianOptimization
python setup.py install
```

Alternatively, if you only want to install the Bayesian optimization library:
```
pip install bayesian-optimization
```

### Prerequisites

You will need:

```
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
jupyter notebook
```

## Lesson Plan

The first goal is to present the first 45 slides of the power point.
This should take about 35 minutes.

The second goal is to present the ipython notebooks which are located in `BayesianOptimization/examples`.
This can be done with:

```
cd BayesianOptimization/examples
jupyter notebook
```

Make sure that you installed the library with
```
python setup.py install
```

First, present `visualization.ipynb`, then with any remaining time present `exploration_vs_exploitation.ipynb`.
This should take the final 15 minutes.
Note how we use the acquisition function to choose where to explore next.
Note how there are local optima's for the acquisiton function.
Note the different choices of acquisition function.
Note the trade off between exploration and exploration.
